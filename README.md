# NewGame++

NewGame++ is a minimal, dark-themed gaming blog built with pure HTML and CSS. It features brutally honest reviews of modern video game titles, presented in a clean card layout with individual review pages.

This project is simple, responsive, and easy to expand. Add more reviews by creating new `.html` files in the `reviews/` folder and linking them from the homepage.

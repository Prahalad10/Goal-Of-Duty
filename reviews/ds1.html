    <h2>Death Stranding</h2>
    <blockquote>“Once, there was an explosion…”</blockquote>

    <p>
      Kojima’s <strong>Death Stranding</strong> is bold, bizarre, and often brilliant. It's a game about isolation, reconnection, and carrying burdens — sometimes literal, sometimes emotional.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are Sam Porter Bridges, a lone courier in a broken world. What starts as simple delivery work slowly evolves into a deeply philosophical journey across haunting landscapes and between fragmented souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      With atmospheric sound design, weighty traversal, and haunting narrative moments, it’s not for everyone — but for those it *is* for, it’s unforgettable.
    </p>

    <blockquote>“Tomorrow is in your hands.”</blockquote>

    <p><strong>Score: 9/10</strong></p>

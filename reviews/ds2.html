    <blockquote>“Should we have connected?”</blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>Death Stranding 2</strong> is more cryptic, more ambitious, and even more philosophical. Kojima doubles down on everything the first game introduced — existential dread, poetic silence, and an undercurrent of hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      The narrative is layered and abstract. The gameplay mechanics feel more refined, and new tools deepen your connection with the world and its people.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's still weird. It's still slow. But it's also somehow more emotionally human.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Score: 9.2/10</strong></p>
